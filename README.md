 those links up there ü°ë  are links to a clicker game that I made.
 if ya look down there, ‚Üô you can see that I made it in and from SCRATCH.
 
 so blocks 1, java 0.
 the game is pretty simple.
 all you do is click the geometry dash ship (that looks bad) and you get points which are called:
 "secret coins" due to the presence of the geometry dash ship (that looks bad).
 did that sound weiird? i dont know, man.
 In the future I will add auto clickers and all that fancy junk.
